Hello There!
I present to yall Flux

Flux is an open-source browser that 
will be rlly much customisable

The code makes an id for every html element
but for those who want more basic customizations
could just look in the settings of the browser


Note that this is just an tab,
We higly recommend using Microsoft Edge

Also note that this is un useable at the time
